# connecthigh

this is one of the first major projects i've worked on. it was built from the ground up within
about two months for a school project/showcase thing. i'd write about its score and criticisms 
but the showcase got cancelled because of the pandemic.

it was written in php and static html/javascript. please let me know what you think about it and
any things i could do or could have done to make it cooler/better.
